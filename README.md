# README

Hello!

Thank you for visiting this project via the link in my CV. You can view my updated CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyuXRL9FBHxp14EdT0qb2uasTNVuQIkL/view?usp=drive_link), which includes a new video demo and some recent adjustments.

Additionally, you can visit the **PUN2** branch, which contains all my code using Photon. In this branch, you'll find just the base code of the game.
