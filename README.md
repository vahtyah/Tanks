# README

Hello!

Thank you for visiting this project from the link in my CV. First of all, I apologize for the rushed edits to my CV, as there may be some minor mistakes. Below are a few important details to help you review and understand my projects better:

## 1. PUN2 Branch
To view the full source code of the project, please switch to the **PUN2 branch**. I have updated and made corrections there, so this is where you’ll find the official code.

## 2. Project Issues
Since the project is not yet complete, there may be some bugs or issues during testing. I’m actively working to fix them and will update them as soon as possible.

## 3. Latest Demo
The latest demo link (the CV might have old demos):  
[Demo Link](https://youtu.be/qrBhr-cxPQY)

## 4. Incorrect GitHub Link
In the second project on my CV, I mistakenly provided the wrong GitHub link because I thought the repository was public. However, the team has decided not to make it public, so I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for taking the time to review my projects, and I hope this gives you a clearer view of my work!
